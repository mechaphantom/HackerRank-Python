## Python - Capitalize!

You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

**Input Format**

A single line of input containing the full name, *S*.

**Constraints**

* 0 < *len(S)* < 1000

* The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

**Note:** in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

**Output Format**

Print the capitalized string, *S*.

**Sample Input 0**

**Sample Output 0**
